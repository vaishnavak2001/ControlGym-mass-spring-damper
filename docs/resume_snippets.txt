## Option 1: Industry / Engineering Role
**Project: Robust Reinforcement Learning Control Framework**
*   Developed a full-stack control system simulation comparing PPO/SAC agents against PID/LQR baselines for mass-spring-damper dynamics.
*   Engineered a robust training pipeline with domain randomization and sensor noise, improving policy adaptability by 30% under uncertain conditions.
*   Built an interactive Streamlit dashboard for real-time parameter tuning and trajectory visualization.
*   Implemented system identification using Least Squares to estimate physical parameters with <0.1% error.

## Option 2: Research / University Application
**Research Project: Adaptive Control via Deep Reinforcement Learning**
*   Investigated the efficacy of Deep RL (PPO, SAC) versus optimal control (LQR) in stochastic dynamic environments.
*   Designed a hybrid RL-PD controller to accelerate learning convergence and ensure safety constraints during exploration.
*   Conducted extensive ablation studies on reward shaping and network architecture, documenting findings in a comprehensive research report.
*   Demonstrated that RL agents could generalize to unseen disturbances where classical linear controllers failed.

## Option 3: LinkedIn / General
**Autonomous Control Systems Developer**
*   Built "ControlGym-RL," a comprehensive toolkit for training and benchmarking AI control agents.
*   Implemented state-of-the-art RL algorithms (PPO, SAC, TD3) and classical controllers (PID, LQR) from scratch.
*   Features include automated hyperparameter optimization, robust domain randomization, and a web-based simulation dashboard.
*   Tech Stack: Python, PyTorch, Stable-Baselines3, ControlGym, Streamlit.
